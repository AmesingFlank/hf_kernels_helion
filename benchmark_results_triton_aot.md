# Helion kernels — AOT pre-tuned vs from-scratch autotuned (Triton backend)

Both columns are the **same Helion kernels on the same B200**, benchmarked
against the same `kernels-community` references. The difference is *how the
config was obtained* — both were tuned by the same (LLM-guided) autotuner:

- **autotuned** (`results/triton/`): from-scratch, per-shape search — the
  `autotune` column is the wall-clock search time (80-150 s/shape) a user would
  pay on first use with no shipped config.
- **pre-tuned** (`results/triton_aot/`): the committed
  `_helion_aot_*_cuda_sm100.py` heuristics, loaded via `@helion.aot_kernel`
  (`HELION_AOT_MODE=evaluate`). No search at run time; the `autotune` column is
  just the one-config compile a downloader pays.

`Δ speed` (= pre-tuned speedup / autotuned speedup) is the generalization cost of
using one shipped config per shape instead of a fresh per-shape search: ≈1.00
means the shipped config matches the individually-tuned one; <1 is slightly
slower, >1 means the shipped config happened to beat the earlier search (autotune
noise). All rows are numerically verified in both modes (✓).

The headline win: run-time search (thousands of seconds total) collapses to a
sub-second per-shape compile. Autotuning-time totals below exclude shapes present
in only one mode.

_Group sizes differ slightly between the two harnesses (random totals when autotuned, fixed totals when pre-tuned), so rows are matched by shape class (small/medium/large); the K/N GEMM dims are identical._

## Summary

- **38 kernel×shape** pairs compared (present in both modes).
- **Total autotune time: 4065s → 38.5s** (106× faster time-to-first-run) — the pre-tuned kernels skip the search entirely.
- **Performance retained: geomean Δ speed = 1.022×** (pre-tuned vs individually-autotuned); i.e. the shipped configs are within ~2% of per-shape-optimal on average.
- Min Δ speed = 0.79×, max = 2.01× across all shapes.
